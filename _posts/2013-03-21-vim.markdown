I'm working with a new old editor. This is not an easy task for me and vim is
not easy to learn.

Let's sumarize the most important things I found about this:

- Stand on the shoulder of giants: please, do not start before you copy the
  dotfiles/vimfiles of someone of your area. (tpope is what I will copy, and
  tanderlove the one I found first).
- Learn some basic keys that you think are not usefull, and how you should use
  them. The main examples I can think of are `.`, `f`, `n`, `*`, `r`.
- Regular expressions are super custom, and `\v` is really needed there.
- Finding the solution is never an easy task, but once you have the solution,
  it keeps working.
